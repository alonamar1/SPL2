In this project, I've implemented a software of a wireless vacum cleaner, that equipped with multiple sensors for perception, allowing them tomap their environment and make informed decisions based on both the map and their internal
state. The included sensors are cameras, LiDAR, GPS, and IMU operating in parallel.
The software supports concurrent data collection and computation while ensuring synchronization with a global clock. Some computations require integrating data from multiple sensors simultaneously.
